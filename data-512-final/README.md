# DATA 512 Final Project
For the final project of the class, Iâ€™m interested in studying the food crisis in the United States using the the US food access data from the Food Access Research Atlas (https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/) and the Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity - Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Nutrition-Physical-Activity-and-Obesity/Nutrition-Physical-Activity-and-Obesity-Behavioral/hn4x-zwk7).
